# StyleGPT (Safari Extension) (Unsigned macOS version)

ü§ñüß© StyleGPT is an extension that will provide you with tools to customize the appearance of ChatGPT according to your preferences. üê¶üåà

## üõ†Ô∏è Steps to activate the extension

1. Move app to "/Applications" folder
2. Allow Unsigned Extensions in Safari App. How:

    1. Open Safari and choose Safari > Settings.
    2. Select the Advanced tab, then select the "Show Develop menu in menu bar" checkbox.
    3. Choose Develop > Allow Unsigned Extensions, enter your password, and click OK. If you are using Safari 17 or later, click the Developer tab in Safari Settings, and select the "Allow unsigned extensions" option. The Allow Unsigned Extensions setting resets when a user quits Safari, so you need to set it again the next time you launch Safari.
    4. Choose Safari > Settings and click the Extensions tab. This tab shows the localized description, display name, and version number for the selected Safari app extension. It also provides a more nuanced message about the permissions for the extension.
    5. Find your new extension in the list on the left, and enable it by selecting its checkbox.
    6. Close Safari Settings.
